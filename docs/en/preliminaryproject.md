### 1. IDENTIFICATION <a name="id1"></a>


+ Project name: Jhoola
+ Students: Abián Gustavo Castañeda Méndez, Diego Peraza Cabo, Samuel Eloy González Díaz
+ Course: 2ºDAW
+ Mentor: Alejandro Martín Zarza

### 2. OBJECTIVES <a name="id2"></a>

This project aims to create a web application dedicated to the reservation and management of hammocks in hotels. The whole process is 
designed to be carried out in the Debian GNU/Linux distribution, being easy to adapt to other existing distributions. The aim of all 
this, is to offer hotel guests the facility to reserve a hammock without being affected by other individuals making use of other objects 
to store them for many hours.

### 3. PRE-ANALYSIS OF WHAT EXISTS <a name="id3"></a>

In many hotels, the allocation of hammocks to guests is poorly managed, leading to conflicts between guests when it comes to taking a 
sunbed. It is unfair for many individuals to wake up first thing in the morning and see that other guests have put their belongings 
in certain places in order to reserve their place, so a system should be put in place to put an end to this unfair practice.

### 4. PRE-ANALYSIS OF THE SYSTEM <a name="id4"></a>

It is trivial to have to manage this new system on paper or through some obsolete management application, therefore, a web application 
that can be accessed from anywhere is ideal, since different tools can be used to manage this process. In addition, in this action 
the guest can have the information of their reservation in case they need it.

### 5. PRE-SYSTEM DESIGN <a name="id5"></a>

For the realization of the project the following will be required:

- **Backend**: as far as the server side is concerned we have chosen to use the Django Web Framework because we are very familiar with this technology.

- **Frontend**: on the client side we will use HTML / CSS because they are vital tools in any project. We will also use JS, Bootstrap 5 and React in order to offer an exquisite and interactive design for the user.

- **Deployment**: for the deployment side of the project we will most likely use an Azure VPS, in addition to the use of the Docker tool.

### 6. COST ESTIMATION <a name="id6"></a>

The cost estimates are as follows:

- **Application**: We have come to the conclusion to offer the first month free of charge and then charge the customer 300€ with support
and 250€ without support (in the case of). The idea is that the customer can earn money from the booking of the guests'
sunbeds without us taking a share of it.

- **VPS**: we have made an estimate and with a VPS with 4 GB RAM, 2 Cores and 200 GB SSD storage it would cost us approximately 30€
per month.

- **Domain**: we have found a fairly reliable price which would be €6.95 per year for the domain.
